            The fact that 55 Cancri e is twice the size of Earth, but has almost 9 times the mass, led astronomers to propose that this Super-Earth could be composed of high pressurized carbon in the form of graphite and diamond mixed with some iron and other elements, according to NASA.

Its parent star is 48 light-years from the Sun, in the constellation Ophiuchus. As of 2017, GJ 1214 b is the most likely known candidate for being an ocean planet.[1][7] For that reason, scientists often call the planet a "waterworld". It is a super-Earth, meaning it is larger than Earth but is significantly smaller (in mass and radius) than the gas giants of the Solar System. After CoRoT-7b, it was the second super-Earth to have both its mass and radius measured[1] and is the first of a new class of planets with small size and relatively low density.[9] GJ 1214 b is also significant because its parent star is relatively near the Sun and because it transits that parent star, which allows the planet's atmosphere to be studied using spectroscopic methods. In December 2013, NASA reported that clouds may have been detected in the atmosphere of GJ 1214 b

            "GJ 1214 b is a Neptune-like exoplanet that orbits an M-type star. Its mass is 8.17 Earths, it takes 1.6 days to complete one orbit of its star, and is 0.0149 AU from its star. Its discovery was announced in 2009.""

            data-summary="Gliese 1132 b is similar to Earth in a striking number of ways. Its radius is only slightly larger, as is its mass. Even its age — 4.5 billion years old — is similar to that of our planet. But this world does have one striking difference, it orbits much closer to its red dwarf parent star, completing an orbit in just 1.6 Earth days. This proximity results in Gliese 1132 b experiencing a much higher surface temperature than our planet at 278 degrees F (137 degrees C), with the intense radiation stripping the exoplanet's atmosphere. 

            Yet, astronomers have recently discovered that something extraordinary is happening on Gliese 1132 b. The gravitational influence of its star — 20% larger than the sun — creates intense tidal forces that squeeze and stretch the planet. This "flexing" gives rise to violent volcanic activity and causes gases to rush to the world’s surface. 
            
            These gases are building the world a second atmosphere, according to NASA. Whilst this is exciting in itself being the first time astronomers have ever spotted anything like this, the "regrown" atmosphere due to its origin also provides astrogeologists with a unique opportunity to study the interior chemical composition of an exoplanet by proxy.

            data-summary="From space, HD 189733 b may appear to be a beautiful and tranquil world, resembling a giant glassy blue marble. With exoplanets, though, appearances can be deceptive, and this definitely the case for this gas-giant planet that completes an orbit of its star in just 2.2 days.

            In fact, its beautiful blue hue arises from its deadly weather, particularly the molten glass rains that pelt the planet's surface. Yet, this isn't the extent of the planet’s almost maniacal weather conditions. The exoplanet — discovered in 2005 by both NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA's XMM Newton's X-ray telescopes — also experiences winds of around 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometers) per hour. These supersonic winds cause the exoplanet’s glass rains to arc sideways towards the ground rather than just falling, also picking up silicate particles, turning them into microscopic projectiles.  "

The star hosts three confirmed planets and a likely fourth, including the lowest-mass exoplanet with a measured mass and size discovered to date, Kepler-138b, with a mass comparable to that of Mars. Kepler-138d is remarkable for its low density initially thought likely to be a gas dwarf,[8] more recent observations as of 2022 show that it, as well as planet c, are likely to be ocean worlds.

            Because Kepler-10 b — discovered in 2011 by the Kepler telescope — is tidally locked to its star it also creates molten droplets of iron and silicates. The planet’s surface is likely covered with lava much hotter than that found on Earth. Because the harsh radiation from its host star has stripped away its atmosphere, these droplets on Kepler-10b won't fall on the nightside of the planet, are instead blown clear of its surface by stellar winds, giving it a fiery tail.
            
            Kepler-10 b isn't the only lava world discovered by the Kepler telescope. In 2013, the space telescope also found the exoplanet Kepler-78b — 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury—that completes a full orbit in a matter of hours. "

These planets are believed to form in traditional ways around stars, but are later flung away by gravitational interactions with other planets.

            Because exoplanets are usually spotted through the effect they have on their host stars, this makes these homeless planets almost impossible to spot. This is especially true when they are Earth-sized rocky planets. That's what makes the discovery of the rogue exoplanet OGLE-2016-BLG-1928 as it wanders the Milky Way so special. While it isn't the first rogue planet to be discovered, it is the smallest, with other examples much similar in size to Jupiter."

The following year it was unofficially dubbed Bellerophon by astronomer Geoffrey Marcy, who followed the convention of naming planets after Greek and Roman mythological figures (Bellerophon is a figure from Greek mythology who rode the winged horse Pegasus).[6] In July 2014, the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.[7] The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name for this planet was Dimidium.. The name was submitted by the Astronomische Gesellschaft Luzern (German for 'Astronomical Society of Lucerne'), Switzerland. 'Dimidium' is Latin for 'half', referring to the planet's mass of approximately half the mass of Jupiter."

            data-summary="The TOI-1452 star system is 99 light-years away from Earth, located in the constellation of Draco. It is a binary pair of dim red dwarf stars separated by only 96 astronomical units (AU). A notable feature of this system is the presence of an exoplanet around one of the stars, designated as TOI-1452 b.[6] It is two M4 dwarf stars that were observed by TESS as a priority, since they are on the cool dwarf list, a list of high-priority orange-red and red dwarf stars, that was uploaded to TESS. It is a flare star, with a flare observed by TESS where the star brightened by 5%. The secondary star is often distinguished from the first with the name TOI-1760.[7] TOI-1452 b was discovered by an international team led by astronomers from the Université de Montréal,[8][9] using data from NASA’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS).[1][10] The discovery was first reported in June 2022.[1]"

            data-summary="Spotted in 2013 and further investigated by the ESPRESSO instrument on the Very Large Telescope in 2020, WASP-76b is a planet that is tidal-locked to its parent star BD+01 316. This means that one side of the planet permanently faces the star causing scorchingly hot temperatures of around 4,532 degrees F (2,500 degrees C) — hot enough to vaporize iron. 

            The star-facing side of WASP-76b is roasted by radiation that is thousands of times more intense than that Earth receives from the sun, while the side that faces away from the F-type star experiences perpetual night. Yet even though the dayside of the planet experiences hellish temperatures, that doesn't mean that conditions on the nightside are a walk in the park. "
